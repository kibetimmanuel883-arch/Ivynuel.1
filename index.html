                <p>
                    This is the part of the story that never got spoken out loud.
                    The part that stayed folded inside me long after silence
                    became the loudest thing between us.

                    IVYNUEL exists because some things deserve to be said
                    once — clearly, gently, and without interruption.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I haven't a single regret about being with you. Besides everything, it has been a journey of love, laughter, and memories that will forever remain in my heart. It has helped me to learn more about myself and the depth of what we shared. This love we shared taught me patience, tenderness and how fully my heart can open to someone I love.

                </p>
                <p>
                    And now, I am ready to move forward with a heart full of gratitude and a soul that remembers you with love.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You mattered. What we had mattered.
                    And even though you chose absence,
                    I chose to remember with grace. You will always have a place in my heart mi dama.

And even though you are gone now, that belief, that memory, will always drive me. Even though that means going on without you by my side.
